    <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>With this data, we are examining how a person’s insurance costs are
        affected by several variables, and we are trying to determine if
        there are any variables leading to people being unfairly charged.
        Linear regression will be our primary way of determining how insurance
        costs are impacted by a factor. The two factors that are used to
        analyze this relationship are the line of best fit and the coefficient
        of determination (also known as R-Squared).<br>
        <br>
        The use of regression showed that many of the categories proved to be
         unhelpful when analyzed for their coefficient of determination.
         While region had an R Squared value of about .43 and sex had an R
         Squared value of about .33, age, bmi, and children had an R Squared
         values between -0 and -1, and smoking had an R Squared value higher
         than 1. When a variable’s R Squared value is not between the range of
         0 and 1, it means that the data provided does not have accurate
         explaining power for the dependent variable when analyzed using linear
          regression.
          <br>
          While the coefficient of determination did not provide conclusive
          explaining power for some of the categories, the line of best fit
          for each variable is able to show us how insurance costs are
          impacted. For age, it is clear that insurance costs increase as
          one grows older. For sex, it appears that women are charged a minor
          amount less compared to men. With bmi, it is apparent that insurance
          cost increases along with a person’s weight, especially once the bmi
          rises above 30. Children seem to also have a negative impact on
          insurance costs, raising a person’s cost as the amount of children
          they have increases. For smoking, it is obvious that smokers are
          charged more for insurance than people who do not smoke. Region can
          not accurately be analyzed by a line of best fit, due to the fact
          that it is not truly a linear variable.
