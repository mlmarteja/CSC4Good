    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Insurance is a contract that receives financial protection or reimbursement
      against losses. In other words, insurance is where everyone in a group
      chips in to help any member of the group with a loss. When deciding
      whether to invest in insurance, it is important to understand the
      risks that comes with it. Although insurance is
      beneficial, it has its problems. Insurance’s assigned risks put
      people into a category, thus many unfortunate individuals are forced
       pay a higher price.

         In this project, we are looking to help indivuals analyze health inruance costs.
         Because helth inruance is important despite age and health, most people have it because no one is pone to a medeical
         emergency. However, it is expensive. For this project, we decided to work with a dataset of a person’s
         health insurance cost along with their age, sex, bmi, number of children,
        region, and whether or not they’re a smoker. We then planned to analyze
         this data using linear regression to determine which of these factors
         have the most effect on a person’s insurance costs. Using this data,
          we could see if there are any demographics being unfairly charged
          for their insurance, such as the elderly, parents, or smokers.

           We have created a tutorial that will walk users
           through a data sience pipeline: gathering, cleaning, statistical
           anlysis, and visualization. This project will illustrate how we utilize
           the data in linear regression to illustrate insurance costs through
           different demographics
