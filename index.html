    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Insurance is a contract that is represented by a policy. It provides
        individuals to recive finanfical reimbursment or protection agansts
        financial loss. However, insruance cost can be unfair for many individuals.
        For example is health insurance. This can be costly despite a person's age
        or health. As a result, many patients would have to pay high out-of-pocket
         cost. Just like health insurnace, other insurances can be costly.
        <br>
        <br>
        For this project, we decided to work with a dataset of a person’s
        insurance cost along with their age, sex, bmi, number of children,
        region, and whether or not they’re a smoker. We then planned to analyze
         this data using linear regression to determine which of these factors
         have the most effect on a person’s insurance costs. Using this data,
          we could see if there are any demographics being unfairly charged
           for their insurance, such as the elderly, parents, or smokers.
           <br>
           <br>
           In this final project, we have created a tutorial that will walk users
           through a data sience pipeline: gathering, cleaning, statistical
           anlysis, and visualization.
