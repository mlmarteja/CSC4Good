    <h2>Linear Regression</h2>
    <p>
      Linear Regression is a model that is utilized to illustrate the relationship
      between two variables.
    </p>
      <h3>Scatter Plots</h3>
      <p>
        Scatter Plots are graphs that are designed to illustrate the relationship between
        the independent and dependent variables. The independent and dependent variables are
         plotted on the x and y axis to identify a linear relationship when analyzing simple regression.
         <br>
         <br>
         In this project, the x-axis contains the indepedent variables such as,
         age, sex, number of children, region, and smokers.
      </p>
      <h3>Line of Best Fit</h3>
      <p>
      Line of best fit is the line through a scatter plot that best
       visualizes the relationship between those two points.
       <br>
       <br>
       To calculate the Line of Best Fit, these are the following steps:
       <ul class="a">
         <li class="b">Calculate the mean of x and y valuess</li>
         <li class="b">Calculate the slope.</li>
         <li class="b">Use the fomula y=mx+b to find the y intercept(b)</li>
       </ul>
     </p>
      <h3>Standard Error and R-Sqaured</h3>
      <p>
        Standard Error is of Regression is the mean distance from the line of
        best fit in relation to the points on the scatter plot. The Standard Error
        is used to calculate the R-Squared. R-Squared is the measurement from zero to one
         of goodness-of-fit for the linear regression model. When the value of R-Sqaured
         is closer to 0%, this means that the line of best fit did not represent the spread
         of the data  around the mean. Whereas, when the value is closer to 100%,
         the variation around the mean is better explained.<br>
         <br>
         To calculate the R-Sqaured of the dataset:
         <li class="b">Find the Standard Error. Let's call this SE line of best fit.</li>
         <li class="b">Find the Standard Error of the y-mean. Let's call this SE y-mean</li>
         <li class="b">R-Squared = 1- [(SE line of best fit)/(SE y-mean)]</li>
       </ul>
