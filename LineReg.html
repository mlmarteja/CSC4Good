    <h2>Linear Regression</h2>
    <p>
      Linear Regression is a model that is utilized to illustrate the relationship
      between two variables.
    </p>
      <h3>Scatter Plots</h3>
      <p>
        Scatter Plots are graphs that are designed to illustrate the relationship between
        the independent and dependent variables. The independent and dependent variables are
         plotted on the x and y axis to identify a linear relationship when analyzing simple regression.
         <br>
         <br>
         In this project, the x-axis contains the indepedent variables such as,
         age, sex, number of children, region, and smokers.
      </p>
      <h3>Line of Best Fit</h3>
      <p>
      Line of best fit is the line through a scatter plot that best
       visualizes the relationship between those two points.
       <br>
       <br>
       To calculate the Line of Best Fit, these are the following steps:
       <br>
       <ul class="a">
         <li class="b">Calculate the mean of x and y valuess</li>
         <li class="b">Calculate the slope.</li>
         <li class="b">Use the fomula y=mx+b to find the y intercept(b)</li>
       </ul>
     </p>
      <h3>Standard Error and R-Sqaured</h3>
      <p>
        Standard Error is of Regression is the average distance from the line of best fit
