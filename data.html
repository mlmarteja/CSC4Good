    <h2>Data Gathering</h2>
      <p>
        Gathering data from a source requires a lot of filtering to get the
         specific data necessary for your project. To filter data you can use
         specific methods to remove unnecessary values from the data.
         Those same methods can be modified to include other values that are
         unnecessary for the data set you need. For example there is a way to
         filter stop words from data. Stop words are commonly repeated words:
         The, and, is, etc. That same method can be used to remove other words
         or values from a set of data. The other part of gathering data is
         storing the data. Depending on what is being stored it will require a
         storage mechanism that accommodates the size and types of data.<br>
         <br>
         We used the following tools to collect this data:
         <ul class="a">
           <li class="b">Pandas</li>
           <li class="b">Numpy</li>
           <li class="b">matplotlib.pyplot</li>
         </ul>
       </p>
        <p>
          To read the csv file, we used <b>pandas.red_csv </b>(more info
          at : <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html">
            https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html</a>)
        </p>
        <p>
          Data collection and filtering is a fickle subject to master.
           Starting out the idea is simple however, the more data that is utilized
           the harder it gets. With more data, you have to start thinking in terms
           of Big O notation. To fully grasp data collection for a regression or
           classification algorithm you must understand big O.
           This concept will make runtimes a lot smaller and the amount
           of code.<br>
           <br>
        </p>


    <h2>Data Ethics</h2>
      <p>Ethics is another topic that is very important when dealing with data
        sets. How you filter the data and with what filters matters. How you
        get the data matters. When using a web crawler you canâ€™t go get data
        from any site because they could have a policy against site users
        trying to scrape data from their site. Another part of ethics is
        how you filter data. You want to use data that is diverse in nature.
        For example when webcam facial recognition software was made the
        software only recognised what the programers gave the software in
        terms of the data set mainly white people. So when other people
        tried to use the software the system didn't know what to do so it
        didn't recognize people of color, or many other races when they tried
        to use the software. It is recommended that thought goes into creating
        a database so that any user of the software can use it correctly
        without issue.</p>

    <h2>Munging, Wanngling, and Cleaning Data</h2>
      <p>The original data was not in a usable state, as much of the data was
        words instead of numbers. In order to make this suitable for regression
        analysis, I assigned each word a numeric value. For men and women, I
        assigned them 0 and 1 respectively. In the smoking field, I made no 0
        and yes 1. For the region, I assigned the regions a number in a
        clockwise manner. Northwest became 0, Northeast became 1, Southeast
        became 2, and Northeast became 3.<br>
        <br>
        We then deleted the empty columns that were used to increase user
        readability but would make it harder for the computer to parse the
        data.
